# Overview
This study aims to predict individuals' likelihood of receiving the H1N1 flu vaccine using survey data from the National Flu Survey (NHFS, 2009). The prediction outputs are intended to provide public health 
professionals and policymakers with insights into factors associated with low vaccination rates, enabling targeted interventions.
Key factors determining vaccination status in our analysis include Doctor Recommendation of H1N1 vaccine, Health Insurance, Opinion of H1N1 Vaccine Effectiveness, and Opinion of H1N1 Risk. 
The primary machine learning model used for prediction in this study is Logistic Regression. It was chosen for its interpretability and ability to provide insights into the factors influencing vaccination behavior.
The insights from this analysis can be valuable for understanding vaccination behaviors and designing effective vaccination campaigns for future pandemics.
