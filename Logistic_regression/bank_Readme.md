# Description
This project focuses on predicting loan approval based on various applicant details. The dataset includes features such as applicant income, loan amount, credit history, and others. The goal is to develop a model 
that can accurately predict whether a loan application should be approved or not.Logistic Regression is used as the primary model for this prediction task. It is well-suited for binary classification problems like
loan approval prediction. The model learns from the historical data to classify new loan applications as either approved or rejected based on the input features.By analyzing the coefficients of the Logistic 
Regression model, we can determine the relative importance of each feature in the loan approval decision. This information can be valuable for both applicants and lenders, as it provides insights into the factors
influencing loan approval and helps in making informed decisions.The performance of the model is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. These metrics provide a comprehensive 
assessment of the model's predictive power and help in fine-tuning the model for better performance.Overall, this project aims to develop a reliable loan approval prediction model using Logistic Regression, 
providing a valuable tool for lenders in assessing loan applications and managing risk effectively.
